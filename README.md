## Prototype data models for understanding weather-related incidents on Great Britain's rail network

This repo presents prototype data models for forecasting weather-related incidents on GB's rail network. Two case study 
examples are demonstrated in the context of delays caused primarily by high winds and temperatures, respectively.
