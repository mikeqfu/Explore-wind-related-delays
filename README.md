### Prototype data models for understanding and predicting weather-related incidents on Great Britain's rail network

This repo presents prototype data models for predicting weather-related incidents on GB's rail network. Two case study examples are demonstrated in the context of delays caused primarily by high winds and temperatures, respectively.

### Brief background

The model was initially developed in a research project which was intended to establish a modelling framework for exploration of the applicability of existing data resources to specific industry problems. The methodology was demonstrated in the context of wind-related 8 delays on the rail network in Great Britain. This case study examined the sub-networks most susceptible to delays as a result of high-wind events; and it identified appropriate data sources that could support the decision-making process around placement of trackside weather stations to monitor the impact of the high wind speeds. 

The study investigates a variety of relevant data sources, including historical records of wind-related incidents, and the weather and vegetation conditions around the incident locations. It shows on how those data could be exploited and modelled with logistic regression analysis. A number of factors contributing to wind-related delay incidents are identified and used for making predictions of likelihood of such incidents occurrences. 

The prototype data model is generic and should also be adaptable to other contexts, e.g. with other categories of weather-related incidents or a wider range of common industry tasks.
